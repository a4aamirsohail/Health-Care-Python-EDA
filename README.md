# Health-Care-Python-EDA

This project explores and analyzes a hospital admissions dataset to uncover operational, financial, and patient-care insights. The workflow covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual exploration using Python.

Key Objectives

Clean and standardize raw healthcare data

Explore patterns in admissions, medical conditions, and patient risk levels

Analyze billing trends across insurance providers

Visualize monthly admission trends and correlations between key numerical features

Insights

Admissions remain steady over time with chronic conditions contributing the most cases

Higher-risk patients show significantly longer hospital stays

Billing amounts differ across insurance providers

A strong inverse relationship exists between length of stay and bill per day

Tools & Technologies
